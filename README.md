## relyq cogs for discord-redbot

### blogs

- i should add a hook whenever the category gets deleted to fix internal sync, otherwise when cat id is fetched the object is none

let users create their own channels - they will be given manage messages perms, and will have an interface to manage the channel settings

docs here

### channel scores

channels get points every time someone posts in the channel and you can sync the scoreboard to discord's channel list to sort the channels by score

i could add exception hooks to get a dm for all uncaught exceptions
